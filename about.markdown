Hi. I am Adi. I'm a software engineer who passionate in solving problem through technologies.

I make this website to share my hobby in writing things. You might find the posts in this site are not focused to one topic. Sometimes I share about software engineering, maybe some random thoughts as well.

Most of the posts I made mostly in Bahasa. I might write some English posts as well, but not too often.
